# Mac OS

This is my configuration of MacOS. I customize lots of tools for developing. Below are the introduction of every tools. All of these are open source which means you can use it without paying.

## borders <a id="borders"></a>

I use JankyBorders to customize my window appearance. It allows you to customize your window borders. You can configure them to be rectangular or rounded, and you can also change their color. You can find the tool on GitHub: https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders.



## btop <a id="btop"></a>

I use this tool for system monitoring.  It provides a user-friendly, terminal-based interface for viewing system information. I find it particularly helpful during development, as it displays CPU and GPU utilization. It's quite convenient. The tool is available on GitHub: https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.



## htop <a id="htop"></a>

It's similar to btop, but with a different look and a cleaner interface.  While it's not as customizable as btop, it's still a great system monitor. Before btop, I used htop.  But btop's customizability won me over. If you prefer a clean interface, check out htop on GitHub: https://github.com/htop-dev/htop.



## kitty <a id="kitty"></a>

Kitty is my favorite terminal emulator. I love it for its speed and low CPU usage.  On top of that, it can even render images in the terminal, which is super convenient for writing Markdown notes with pictures.  Here's the GitHub link: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty.



## latex <a id="latex"></a>

LaTeX is the ideal language for document preparation.  Unlike Microsoft Word, which is widely used, LaTeX automatically manages layout, freeing me from manual formatting adjustments. This file contains my Neovim configuration for LaTeX. It is not a GitHub repository.



## neofetch <a id="neofetch"></a>

`neofetch` is a tool that presents system information in ASCII format within the terminal. It serves as a convenient way to showcase one's computer hardware and operating system.  However, development has ceased, and the GitHub repository is now read-only: https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch.



## nvim <a id="nvim"></a>

Neovim is my preferred text editor for software development. While it offers comparable functionality to IDEs like Visual Studio Code, it distinguishes itself through lower CPU utilization and faster startup times.  My configuration includes separate setups for general development and LaTeX authoring. Users can select the appropriate configuration based on their intended use.  Neovim's GitHub repository is located at: https://github.com/neovim/neovim.  I utilize LazyVim for package management: https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim.



## ranger <a id="ranger"></a>

Ranger is my terminal file manager.  Since I've been using Arch Linux for a while, I'm comfortable navigating files in the terminal, so Ranger is a perfect fit. Here's the GitHub repo: https://github.com/ranger/ranger.



## tmux <a id="tmux"></a>

For remote access to my Arch Linux server, I utilize tmux.  Its ability to divide terminal windows is essential for my workflow. This configuration file implements a Catppuccin theme.  The tmux GitHub wiki can be found at: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki.



## zathura <a id="zathura"></a>

Zathura is my PDF reader, and it's great for working with LaTeX.  It automatically updates the PDF as I compile my LaTeX document, so I can see the results instantly. Here's the GitHub link: https://github.com/pwmt/zathura
